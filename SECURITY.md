# Security policy

## Reporting

If you believe you have found:

- a vulnerability in the verification/integrity workflow, or
- a way to silently alter core artifacts (Shard/Kernel/Companion) without detectable change, or
- any issue that could plausibly lead to unsafe real-world guidance,

please report it **privately** using GitHub Security Advisories for this repository (preferred), or open an Issue marked clearly as security-sensitive if an advisory is not available.

## What to include

- The exact file name(s) and section anchor(s).
- A minimal description of the exploit/failure mode.
- Reproduction steps (or a small PoC) where possible.
- Expected vs observed behavior.

## Non-goals

- General philosophical disagreement (use Discussions).
- Requests to weaken refusal/ledger requirements (use Discussions; expect adversarial review).
